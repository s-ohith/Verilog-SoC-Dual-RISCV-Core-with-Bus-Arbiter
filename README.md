## üß† Project Overview
![Uploading image.png‚Ä¶]()


This repository contains a complete and synthesizable SoC designed in Verilog, showcasing a **dual-core RISC-V processor architecture** that runs **two separate programs** concurrently. These cores share access to a **common set of peripherals**‚ÄîSPI, I2C, and USART‚Äîvia a **custom bus arbiter** that implements a **round-robin priority mechanism**.

This project is designed to demonstrate:

- Multi-core processor design
- Shared resource management
- Memory-mapped peripheral communication
- SoC simulation and verification flow

It is suitable for **educational purposes**, **SoC verification practice**, and **understanding digital design concepts** in real-world scenarios.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Architecture and Design Concepts

### üß© Dual-Core RISC-V Architecture

- **Cores**: `riscv_core` and `riscv2core`
- Each has its own **instruction memory**.
- Each runs a **completely separate program** (independent PC, ALU, register file).
- Both share a **common APB bus** for accessing peripherals.

> This setup mimics real-world multi-core systems, where cores execute different tasks but synchronize through shared memory/peripherals.

---

### üß© APB Peripheral Subsystem

- **Module**: `soc_top`
- Connected to the cores via the **Advanced Peripheral Bus (APB)**.
- Uses **address decoding logic** to enable peripherals.

#### üì¶ Included Peripherals
- `spi_apb_slave` + `spi_driver` ‚Äî SPI Master
- `i2c_apb_slave` + `i2c_driver` ‚Äî I2C Master
- `usart_apb_slave` + `usart_driver` ‚Äî Serial communication

Each peripheral supports **basic transmission** and responds to **read/write transactions** issued via MMIO.

---

### üß© Memory-Mapped I/O (MMIO)

- Cores interact with peripherals via **standard load (`lw`) and store (`sw`) instructions**.
- **Peripheral registers** are mapped into specific memory ranges.
- No special instructions are needed‚Äîjust **memory reads/writes** to specific addresses.

#### üîÑ Flow:
1. Core issues a `sw` or `lw` instruction.
2. Address falls into peripheral range.
3. Interconnect routes the access to the APB bus.
4. Peripheral receives the transaction and processes it.

---

### üß© Bus Arbitration and Interconnect

- Both cores **share the APB bus**, so a **round-robin arbiter** ensures **fair and conflict-free access**.
- **Priority toggles** between cores after each successful access.

#### üö¶ Arbiter Logic:
- Start: Core 1 has priority.
- After Core 1 uses the bus ‚Üí priority ‚Üí Core 2.
- If priority core is idle, the other core gets access.
- **Multiplexer-based interconnect** routes selected core's address/data lines to the APB interface.
