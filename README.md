# Verilog-SoC-Dual-RISCV-Core-with-Bus-Arbiter
A complete System-on-Chip (SoC) in Verilog featuring a dual-core RISC-V processor. The design integrates two independent cores with a shared APB peripheral bus (SPI, I2C, USART) managed by a round-robin arbiter. The project includes a full testbench to demonstrate simultaneous multi-core operation and peripheral communication.
